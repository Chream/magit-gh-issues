* magit-gh-issues

  =magit-gh-issues= is a [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] extension that allows you to
  conveniently view Github issues. It works similar to
  =magit-gh-issues=.

  *This extension is a work in progress and supports open issues only*

** Installation

   =magit-gh-issues= is not yet available on [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]. Installation
   requires adding =magit-gh-issues= to your load-path manually:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/magit-gh-issues")
   (require 'gh)
   (require 'gh-users)
   (require 'magit-gh-issues)
   (add-hook 'magit-mode-hook #'turn-on-magit-gh-issues)
   #+END_SRC

** Usage

   In =magit-status= window press =# g i= to refresh the list of
   issues.  =magit-gh-issues= automatically infers credentials from
   the URL of the repository. If there are issues available, a new
   section will appear called *Issues*. Each item in this section has
   the following form:

   : [# issue-number@user (status)] title

   Highlighting an issue and pressing =# g b= will open the issue
   using =browse-url=
